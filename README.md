## Build Process

Due to this being my first attempt at building both a front-end client and back-end api.The goal was to keep the application as simple as possible. While using the techniques and methods we learned in the second unit of the program. I Focused on building out the API aspect of the project first, then moved on to the front end and lastly css to style the application as nicely as possible.

## Unsolved Problems
I am yet to add a nav bar for the CRUD actions and make application mobile friendly.
